# tictactoe

A simple Java implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game. This console-based game allows a player to compete against an AI opponent.
The player makes moves by specifying the column (A, B, or C) and row (1, 2, or 3), while the AI opponent makes random moves. 
The game continues until there is a winner or the board is full, resulting in a draw.
